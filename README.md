# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

# KRS_Knowledge Revising System
Presenting by     Group 6 


## Description
The KRS_Knowledge Revising System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate knowledge revising and exam preparation for students and educators. It offers various features tailored to different user roles, including administrators, managers, teachers, students, and guests.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Set up environment variables for configuration (e.g., database connection, API keys).
4. Run the application: npm start

## Usage
Access the application through the provided URL.
Log in with your credentials or register as a new user.
Navigate through the dashboard based on your role and access the relevant features.
Follow on-screen instructions for specific actions such as creating lessons, managing accounts, or participating in discussions.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md for contributing to this project.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
