## Description
The KRS_Knowledge Revising System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate knowledge revising and exam preparation for students and educators. It offers various features tailored to different user roles, including administrators, managers, teachers, students, and guests.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
